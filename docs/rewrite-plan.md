# CBE Thermal Comfort Tool — v1 rewrite plan

## Context

The current repository `main repo/comfort-tool` is a Svelte 5 app, 301 files / 49k lines, with too many layers to remain maintainable
(`declarations/` + `catalog/` + `state/modelRegistry/` + `engines/` — four layers referencing each other,
and `state/modelRegistry/builder.ts` alone is 1274 lines). ADR-0001 reached consensus: **reuse no code,
borrow only verified behaviour**, rewrite against the new architecture, targeting delivery of v1 on 2026-10-01.

Calculation logic moves out into the forked `jsthermalcomfort` (`typescript` branch); the app is left with only "declare models + render",
> **2026-09-13**: the fork is abandoned. The library is the main repository's `ModelInfo` interface, per [ADR-0002](adr/0002-library-interface-model-info.md); everything below that names `io` / `reference` / `charts` or the fork is pre-meeting history.

> **2026-09-15 — position**: the ADR-0002 migration has landed on `rewrite/v1-main-repo` as five commits (`bf95aac` C1 quantities, `221889f` C2 zone geometry, `175f330` C3 applicability, `5373f92` C4 declaration / standards / results, `9c6df55` C5 cutover and lint); the four scripts are green. Acceptance (ticket 06 in `.scratch/adr-0002-migration/issues/`): no subpath import remains; the Phase 3.5 result-table parity re-run against the deployed tool's `comf.pmvEN` is bit-identical at the kernel; the 42 zone vertices match. The Heat Index two-file dry run passed every layer below the type boundary and failed `check` at it — that gap is now a Phase 4 prerequisite. Phase 3.6 items 3, 5 and 6 are still open; ADR-0002 carries amendments 15–19 from the migration spec. The `ModelResult` / registry-type gap closed 2026-09-15 as `c5f8ba6`. Phase 3.6 items 3, 5 and 6 were decided the same day: item 3 moves to Phase 4b with its first consumer; items 5 and 6 are specified in `.scratch/presets-and-model-select/` and are Phase 4's last prerequisite.

> **2026-09-17 — position**: Phase 3.6 items 5 and 6 have landed (`1f0fa93` core presets, `984b30b` preset input, `77dbc07` model select). The Heat Index two-file dry run was re-run against the result: `test`, `check`, `lint` and `build` all green, `git diff --stat` at exactly `src/models/heatIndex.ts` and `src/models/index.ts`. Phase 4 prerequisite 3 is done; Phase 4 waits on nothing.

> **2026-09-17 — library boundary audit** (ADR-0002 decisions 21–26; spec and tickets in `.scratch/library-boundary/`): every export of `src/core` and `src/models` was sorted under the four rules (pythermalcomfort has it → jsthermalcomfort must, port first, never copy; jsthermalcomfort has it → import; a standalone SI-in SI-out calculation neither has → the **temporary library** `src/temporary-library/`, written to the library's conventions and lint-restricted to importing `jsthermalcomfort` alone; presentation → app). Result: app code except (1) five library changes that live unmerged on `local/comfort-tool-integration` (the branch the app actually links, correcting d.14): the humidity inverses `dcca8b9`, the `pmv_ppd_iso` JSDoc fix `ea4a6f5`, the preset tables `1daa7d9` (renamed to pythermalcomfort's three names, d.26, and merged as PR #210 on 2026-09-18), a new `warnings` field on `pmv_ppd`'s result (#199 option (a), d.23), and `standards: Standard[]` on `_INFO` (d.25, merged as PR #211 on 2026-09-19); and (2) the temporary library's first members: the zone solver, the CBE root finders and the `chart-online.json` oracle (d.24, ticket 07). Tickets 01–04 and 06 are the upstream PRs, opened by hand; ticket 05 deletes the app's applicability evaluation once 04 is on the branch; ticket 07 is the move. Unit conversion stays app: all state is SI, only the UI converts. Phase 4 is not blocked by any of this.

> **2026-09-18 — position**: ticket 07 has landed (`127bf16`): the zone solver, the CBE root finders and `chart-online.json` live in `src/temporary-library/`, fenced by lint, and `core/compute/` is gone. Two follow-ups the same day: `e628ef1` names what is PMV-only after PMV (`pmv_psychrometric_zone`, `PmvFunction`, `PmvPsychrometricZone`; "model" stays reserved for registered models and library model functions), and `d2c09e6` solves the zone on the model's own `run` (ADR-0002 d.18 revised): `run` returns unrounded output, the psychrometric chart builds the zone's PMV function from it, and a declaration no longer writes a second kernel call, so PPD now shows two decimals and the app's `pmv` applicability row tests the same unrounded value the kernel does. The four scripts are green and the Heat Index two-file dry run is still two files. Tickets 01–06 are unchanged; Phase 4 still waits on nothing.

> **2026-09-19 — position**: ticket 04 has landed: the `warnings` field is `e31a562` on `feat/v2-typescript-setup` (#199 option (a); checks and bounds match pythermalcomfort 4.6.0, including ASHRAE 55's airspeed rules without airspeed control; filled whatever `limit_inputs` is, which the app needs since it always passes `false`). `local/comfort-tool-integration` is retired (ADR-0002 d.22 revised): from now on every library change the app needs is committed directly to `feat/v2-typescript-setup`, which `../jsthermalcomfort` has checked out, and no PR is opened for it. The 2026-09-17 entry's "upstream PRs, opened by hand" no longer applies. Ticket 05 has landed (`faac928`, docs `01eb8d3`): `core/applicability.ts` maps the result's `warnings` and evaluates no row itself; the pre-call gate is unchanged. The library-boundary tickets are all closed, and Phase 4 still waits on nothing.

> **2026-09-21 — position**: a grilling session on the Worker boundary and on what the threshold editor bins ended somewhere else (ADR-0002 decisions 27–31; spec and tickets in `.scratch/numeric-scan-and-model-name/`). The dynamic chart scans the **number** (`output: q.pmv`) and the declaration pairs it with its classifier by dot access (`bands: PMV_PPD_ISO_INFO.outputs.tsv.classifier`); `GRID` drops from 100 to **51**, measured: a grid of band indices puts every boundary half a cell off, a grid of numbers puts it within a pixel at a quarter of the calls. At 51×51 the ASHRAE scan is 88 ms, so **v1 has no Worker**: Comlink, the stamp and the "computing" indicator go, and `compute.svelte.ts` is redesigned as synchronous derivation. A model is named by the library's function name (`name: "pmv_ppd_iso"` replaces `pathSegment`; route segment `pmv-ppd-iso`, file `pmvPpdIso.ts`). Standard will draw the comfort zone only and Explore the editable bands, a Band list being the library's `ClassifierBins` plus colours; that split lands with Explore in Phase 5. **Phase 4 now has a fourth prerequisite**, because the numeric scan and the model name change the declaration's shape.

> **2026-09-22 — position**: **Phase 4 prerequisite 4 is done.** Seven tickets landed on `rewrite/v1`: 01 `f74ce9a` (the route lookup out of the router module), 03 `e137a65` + `1cd48bc` (the numeric scan), 04 `319c1af` (`GRID = 51`), 07 `042c0f7` (one constraint contour per Band, written after the other six and replacing 03's interim remap — ADR-0002 decision 27 as revised 2026-09-22), 02 `b76bdba` (the model name), 05 `19590ca` + `7651f06` (synchronous compute, and the Worker removed). The Heat Index two-file dry run was re-run on the new declaration shape (`name: "heat_index_rothfusz"`, `output: q.hi`, `bands: HEAT_INDEX_STRESS_CATEGORY_BINS`): all four scripts green, `git diff --stat` at exactly `src/models/heatIndexRothfusz.ts` and one line of `src/models/index.ts`, then discarded. **No test file was touched, and the test count did not move** (126 either way): the registry-wide checks loop over `registeredModels` inside a single `it()` each, so the second model arrived as extra assertions rather than extra cases — its name proved against the package, its uniqueness, and its binning against the kernel at nine probes straddling the four Edges its `tdb` axis reaches. Its Edges come through unevenly spaced and untouched (intervals 5, 9, 13, 946), which is ticket 07's real-model check. Two things the dry run surfaced and did not fix, both now tickets. One: `core/libraryInputs.ts`'s `enteredQuantities` expands a `tdb` input into the whole temperature-mode panel, so a model taking `tdb` without `tr` gets a phantom mean-radiant-temperature row in the input panel. Nothing in Phase 4 can see it — Heat Index has no page until Explore — and it is a Phase 5 prerequisite, not a third file here. Two: the registry drift test does **not** catch a kernel that rounds its output, although its own comment says it does — re-registering Heat Index with the library's default rounding leaves the suite green, because the bisection that brackets each Edge follows the rounded output and lands on the rounding step, where the app and the kernel still agree. Decision 27 retired decision 17's rounding rule on the strength of that test, so the probe placement is worth correcting. **Phase 4 waits on nothing.**

> **2026-09-22 — position, later the same day**: a grilling session on the four tickets the close-out left behind (08–11) widened to switching models and to the shape of `run` (ADR-0002 decisions 32–35; CONTEXT.md's **Applicability** revised). **Phase 4 waits on one thing again**: `run` changes shape, which is cheapest while there is one model file. It stays a function and reads its values by `Quantity`, `(values) => pmv_ppd_iso(...values(q.tdb, q.tr, …), 0, ISO_EDITION, { … })`; the keyed `Record<string, number>` and `keyedInputs` go, and a registry-wide test proves the positions against the library function's own parameter names (ticket 12, Phase 4 prerequisite 5). The call written as data was considered at length and rejected: only a direct call lets a differently shaped model change no other file, lets the compiler see the library's signature, and gets better for free when the library becomes TypeScript. **The model-switch dialog moves from Phase 5 item 2 to a Phase 4b prerequisite**, because Phase 4b is where two models first share the Standard page: the switch is rehearsed on a copy of the slot (convert entry mode, seed missing quantities from the new model's defaults, ask the gate), lists exactly what the pre-call gate would flag, and "No, stay here" leaves the slot untouched; it has its own feature folder, `.scratch/model-switch/`, still to be specified. **The gate freezes the result, not the screen** (tickets 08 and 09, merged): it keeps the last valid inputs of the current model and derives the rest, so unit system, chart type and axes still take effect while an entry is out of range, and a model change drops what was kept. That is a Phase 4b prerequisite too — ticket 08 said Phase 4, but Heat Index has no standard and so no route. Ticket 11 is rewritten: rather than moving the drift probes, a registry-wide test asserts directly that `run` is unrounded, and the drift test's comment stops claiming it. It is not a prerequisite, but landing it before Phase 4 means the second model, which rounds by default, is checked on arrival. Ticket 10 stands as written. Three upstream gaps are recorded in `.scratch/library-boundary/spec.md`: `ModelInfo` carrying its own name; `utci` rounding to one decimal with no switch, to close before Phase 6; and an object parameter for the model functions, for the TypeScript port.

> **2026-09-22 — position, close of day**: **Phase 4 prerequisite 5 is done** (`1dfc37f`), so Phase 4 waits on nothing. `run` is `(values) => result`: `values(...quantities)` answers one number per `Quantity` as a tuple of the same length, spread at the head of the library's positional call, and the keyed `Record<string, number>` and `keyedInputs` are gone. The tuple is what makes the compiler count the arguments and spell a kwarg — two `@ts-expect-error` fixtures fail as `TS2578` the day it stops doing so. What it cannot see, `tdb` and `tr` being numbers alike, a registry-wide test does: the keys of the quantities `run` asked for against the leading parameter names of the library function, read off the unminified `lib/esm`. Proven red by swapping the two, where `npm run check` reports **0 errors**. `toLibraryInputs` keeps its name and returns the reader, so `state/compute.svelte.ts`, the dynamic chart and two test files needed no edit (ADR-0002 decision 11: deleting it would scatter the resolve-then-wrap composition across three sites). The Heat Index dry run was repeated on the new shape and stayed at the declaration file and the registry line. Two corrections found on the way: the ticket's premise about `.claude/rules/architecture.md` was wrong — its "No duplicated definitions" paragraph never named `keyedInputs`, so nothing needed correcting there — and the `toLibraryInputs` tests covered two of the five humidity representations ADR §7.10 item 9 asks for, closed as `43b6682`. That last one turned up an upstream gap, now the third "Model-function gaps" row in `.scratch/library-boundary/spec.md`: `t_dp` hard-codes `round(…, 1)` and `t_wb` a bare `Math.round`, with no switch, so `psy_ta_rh` reports both quantised to 0.1 °C — 0.055 %rh of round-trip error at 25 °C. Whether pythermalcomfort rounds them too is unchecked, so whether it is a rule A parity gap is open. **Next: ticket 11, then Phase 4.**

> **2026-09-22 — position, Phase 4 passed**: **the architecture acceptance is through.** Ticket 11 landed first (`95bfbcf`): the registry-wide "the run's numbers come back unrounded" test, proven red against a fixture whose `run` rounds (ADR-0002 decision 35). Heat Index (Rothfusz) is then registered as **`e53a07a`**, and the acceptance passed on its own terms — **two files** (`git diff --stat` at exactly `src/models/heatIndexRothfusz.ts` and one line of `src/models/index.ts`) and **the test count unchanged**, 136 before and after, because every registry-wide check loops inside a single `it()`, so a second model arrives as extra assertions and no test file is touched. The four scripts are green. Both new probes were shown to reach the model: registering it rounded fails the unrounded-run test, and swapping `tdb` and `rh` fails the position test while `npm run check` reports 0 errors. **Phase 4 is closed; Phase 4b still waits on `PMV_PPD_ASHRAE_INFO` and `ADAPTIVE_ASHRAE_INFO` upstream.**

> **2026-09-22 — position, close of day: Phase 4b's two app-side prerequisites are done.** The model-switch feature landed on `rewrite/v1` as four commits (`.scratch/model-switch/`: 01 `9c67d63` a model set by address gets a slot it can run on, 02 `0a35e39` the select requests a model rather than navigating to it, 03 `6e6c36d` a switch that breaks Applicability asks first, 04 `2ffddfe` the navigation links ask too), and the gate's side as `6ad4caa` (decision 33; ticket 08 in `.scratch/numeric-scan-and-model-name/`). The four scripts are green, 167 tests. **ADR-0002 decision 32 is revised** with what the feature found (ticket 05): the decision's "the check runs in the model select's handler" was written before the navigation links had a handler, and the rule is really "every in-app switch asks, every address arrival does not" — a link the browser opens elsewhere, by a modifier click, the middle button or the context menu, is an address arrival. Following from that, `navigateTo` now pushes and a new `redirectTo` replaces, used only by the unknown-address fallback, so back returns to the previous model however the person switched. The rehearsal is `core/modelSwitch.ts`, a `core/` file ADR-0001 §5's tree does not list, recorded in the revision as decision 6 recorded `core/applicability.ts`; the dialog is at `ui/inputs/` rather than the reserved `ui/dialogs/`, decided with the project lead rather than resolved by moving the file. The whole exchange was walked in the running app against a temporary second registered model, since reverted — both ways of switching, yes and no, Escape and the close button, SI and IP, mouse and keyboard, a link in a new tab, a typed address, and the back button into a model an entered value breaks, which is the path that needed decision 33: it shows an **empty result**, not the previous model's numbers under the new model's name. Console clean throughout. Reported and not fixed: `src/state/session.svelte.test.ts` is 411 lines, past ADR §6's 100–400 band, and the out-of-range caption still says "Showing the last valid result" on a model that has none. **Phase 4b now waits only on `PMV_PPD_ASHRAE_INFO` and `ADAPTIVE_ASHRAE_INFO` upstream.**

> **2026-09-26 — position: the app is on the library's v2 shape.** The library v2 migration pass landed on `rewrite/v1` as five commits (`.scratch/library-v2-migration/`): 01 `e47b86c` `run` calls every model with one params object, 02 `578cd54` a model's name is read from its model info, 03 `4812b99` and its follow-up `b64c21b` the zone solver takes one params object with `pmv_limit` required and the reproduced-defect switch deleted, 04 `b37eb5f` the PMV (ISO 7730) page draws categories A, B and C and prints the room's category. It consumes `jsthermalcomfort` on `feat/v2-typescript-setup` through `cee6893`, the library's v1-models parity tickets 01–12: one params object on every v1 model, `ModelInfo.name`, `warnings` rows on all five models, `PMV_COMPLIANCE_INTERVAL_ASHRAE`, `utci`'s `round_output`, and `pmv_ppd_iso`'s `category` with `PMV_CATEGORY_BINS_ISO`. Against the rebuilt package before the pass, `npm run check` reported 11 errors and 62 tests failed; after it the four scripts are green, and the test count went 179 → 176 → 174 → 172 → 180 across the four tickets, down by exactly the deleted tests and up by ticket 04's eight. ADR-0002 decisions 8, 24, 30, 31, 34, 35 and 36 carry dated revision notes; the library-boundary spec's `ModelInfo` and model-function gap tables are marked row by row, every row closed with its library commit but two: the classifier pairing stays in the app, and the psychrometric inverses still round; one library request, that `ClassifierBins` document its final edge as a sentinel, is recorded in the library's queue. **Phase 4b resumes at its ticket 03.**

and the one rule is "**adding a model = one declaration file + one registry line, zero other files change**".

The toolchain does not need to be rebuilt: the `refactor-draft` branch is already on the Vite 8 / TS 6 / Svelte 5.56 /
Tailwind 4 / Vitest 4 / sv-router 0.18 the ADR asks for, and `jsthermalcomfort` is `file:../jsthermalcomfort`, the main
repository, whose `lib/esm/` build output the app consumes (a library change needs `npm run build` there first).
What is unmaintainable is `src/`, not `package.json`.

### Decided

| Decision | Conclusion |
|---|---|
| Starting point | New branch in the same repository + `git rm -r src tests docs`, keeping build config and brand assets |
| v1 model scope | ADR §7: PMV (ISO 7730) + Adaptive (ASHRAE 55), with UTCI as architecture acceptance |
| Library branch | The fork's `typescript` (`for-new-CBE` and `Feature/export-model-metadata` were both branched from `main` before the TS rewrite and are abandoned) |
| Library / app boundary (2026-09-03) | The test: "would pythermalcomfort ship it?" (ADR §3). Applicability limits → library `reference/`; steps, unit conversion, default values, option copy, route path segments, `ModelDefinition` → app. Library-side work is done in a separate chat using the standalone prompt below |
| Second round (2026-09-03) | Limits are done as source in the library, not mirror; standard membership goes into the library as `reference.standards` + `model.standard`, the app only adds path segments; closed sets become `as const` object collections, not enum classes; operative mode uses the `t_o` quantity + `psychrometricZone.trFollowsDb`; quantity names come only from `Quantity.label` |
| Psychrometric chart geometry | Reproduce the chart already published by the old CBE tool; no defect is reproduced (ADR-0002 decision 24 as revised 2026-09-25) |
| Scope review (2026-09-04, after Phase 3) | PMV (ASHRAE 55) joins v1 — it is the deployed tool's main screen and was missing from every list by oversight; input calculators become Phase 5b, narrowed to custom ensemble + dynamic predictive clothing + solar gain; the ES5 summary page is downgraded to a static notice; the site shell joins Phase 6; `suppressWarnings` goes into the library; chart axis ranges and the dynamic zone source move into the model declaration; field charts never snap on hover; local discomfort is deferred with its direction recorded (standalone models under the ASHRAE tab, not the legacy button panel) |
| Visual design (2026-09-04) | It had no phase at all, and ADR §7.4 referred to a design mock-up no phase produced. Split in two: token and primitive groundwork in Phase 3.6, the design itself in a new Phase 5c after Compare / Explore settle the layout. The site shell moves from Phase 6 into 5c. Deferring is safe because ADR §2's utility-class ban keeps appearance out of business components |
| Code quality (2026-09-04) | Two audit passes against `docs/code-quality-checklist.md` — full before the Phase 4 acceptance, narrow after it. Anything mechanically checkable becomes a lint rule with a probe. *Clean Code* / *Clean Architecture* are not acceptance criteria; the verified sources are Svelte Best practices, the TypeScript handbook's Do's and Don'ts, the Google TypeScript Style Guide, and DRY as Hunt & Thomas state it |
| **Library interface (2026-09-13, with the lead)** | The app consumes the main repository's `ModelInfo` / `_INFO` / `ClassifierBins` / `Standard` from the package root; the fork is abandoned. Quantities become an app table keyed by `_INFO` keys; applicability is evaluated in the app until #199; axis ranges are declared, else applicability, else error; comfort-zone geometry moves into the app (since decision 24, `src/temporary-library/`); the four humidity inverses go upstream first; thin wrappers go; v1 = models with an `_INFO`, second-model acceptance on `heat_index_rothfusz`. All fourteen decisions in [ADR-0002](adr/0002-library-interface-model-info.md) |
| Dynamic chart, Worker, model name (2026-09-21) | The dynamic chart scans the numeric output on a 51×51 grid and the declaration pairs it with its classifier (`output` + `bands`); no Worker in v1; a model is named by the library's function name; a Band list is `ClassifierBins` plus colours, Standard draws the comfort zone and Explore the bands. ADR-0002 decisions 27–31 |

### Library inventory (`typescript` @ d57c456, runtime exports verified one by one)

> **Obsolete since 2026-09-13** (ADR-0002): this inventory describes the fork. Kept as history.

**Already there, directly usable:**

| ADR clause | Implementation in the library |
|---|---|
| §4.1.3 Measure | `io.pmvPpdIso/pmvPpdAshrae/adaptiveAshrae/adaptiveEn` → `.toMeasures()` → `Measure{quantity,value,unit,category,intervals}` |
| §4.1.2 Classification scale | `reference.{isoThermalSensation, ashraeThermalSensation, adaptiveAshraeOffsets, adaptiveEnOffsets, enCategoryPmvLimits}`, `IntervalScale.classify/labelFor` |
| §4.1.1 Quantity | `io.quantities` — 12 quantities, with `key/kind/label/siUnit/ipUnit`. Units are just symbol strings, and that is enough: conversion belongs to the app |
| **§4.7 boundary root-finding + §5 `zoneBoundary.ts`** | **`charts.psychrometricZone` (ported from the CBE original, `rhStep`/`saturationStep`/`epsilon` configurable) + `bisect`/`secant`** |
| §4.4 Adaptive real rendering | `charts.adaptiveAshraeZone` / `adaptiveEnZone` |
| Model metadata (partial) | `pmv_ppd_iso.{label,description,tsv}`, `pmv_ppd_ashrae.{label,description,tsv,compliance,COMPLIANCE_LIMIT}`, `adaptive_*.{label,description,offsets}` |
| Raw material for input calculators | `clo_dynamic_ashrae` / `clo_dynamic_iso`, `v_relative`, `running_mean_outdoor_temperature`, `met_typical_tasks`, `clo_individual_garments` |

> **Do not write `zoneBoundary.ts` (ADR §5)** — the library already has it; just pass `rhStep: 5`.

**Gaps (→ library prompt below):**
Applicability limits are only hard-coded inside the compliance functions, and also embedded in the warning copy, with no data export
(the comment near line 275 of `utilities.ts` already promises that `reference/limits.ts` records the ISO met lower-bound discrepancy,
but that file currently holds only the EN category limits); models do not declare their standard membership, the standard lives only
in the `label` string, the `standard` parameter of `pmv_ppd` is a calculation-variant selector and `utilities.Standard` is a compliance
dispatch key — neither is membership; `quantities` lacks `t_o` (operative temperature, the input quantity and chart axis of
operative mode) and `p_atm` (Phase 5 atmospheric pressure); `psychrometricZone` only accepts a fixed `tr` and cannot express
operative mode's `tr = db` (`psychrometricTrEqualsTdb` in the old prototype's `declarations/pmv/calculation.ts:77`);
the `Standard` constant is placed inside an `export type {}` block, and `valid_range` is not in the barrel.

The other gaps previously assumed (`Unit/toSi/fromSi/step`, the `ModelDefinition` registry, `OptionSpec`,
`defaultValue`, the `inputs/outputs` list, adding `id` to offsets) were all assigned to the app or found unnecessary
in the 2026-09-03 boundary review; see ADR §3 / §4.1.5. The decisive evidence: the library's IP air-speed unit is fps
while the CBE tool displays fpm — display units were never the library's business.

### Two ADR corrections (already applied to the ADR)

1. **`epsilon` is not a temperature tolerance.** `comfort_zone.ts` explicitly comments that it is the **PMV residual**;
   the CBE original's `"ta precision"` comment is wrong. ADR §1 / §2 / §4.7 have been changed.
2. **The §3 vs §4.6 conflict** is resolved: unit conversion belongs to the app's `core/units.ts`, the exception spelled out in ADR §3;
   the app calls the library with SI only.

## How to use this plan

Each Phase is designed to be executed in **its own new Claude chat**. When opening a new chat, start with:
"Read `docs/adr-0001-architecture.md` and `CLAUDE.md`, then execute Phase N".

**Model and effort.** Set once with `/model` at the start of each chat; do not change it mid-Phase
(switching models invalidates the prompt cache).

| Phase | Model | Effort |
|---|---|---|
| 0, 1, 4, 6 — execute a written checklist | Opus 5 | `high` |
| 2, 3, 5 — write new code | Opus 5 | `xhigh` |
| Plan mode, Phase 2 and Phase 5 only | Opus 5 | `max` |
| Read-only investigation subagents | Opus 5 | `low` |

Only Phases 2 and 5 repay plan mode — 2 because its ten steps are coupled and a wrong
`defineModel` field invalidates the Phase 4 acceptance, 5 because its five sub-features need an
order and a moment to freeze the share schema. Phase 4 must be executed directly: planning it
invites discovering "a third file also needs to change" and quietly changing it, which is exactly
what the acceptance exists to catch.

Escalate to Fable 5.1 (2x the token price) only if the Phase 4 acceptance fails. Reasoning backwards
from a third touched file to the wrong field in `defineModel` is the one piece of work in this plan
with no checklist to follow; everything else is execution precision, which Opus 5 at `xhigh` covers.

> **The most important step in Phase 0 is rewriting `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md`.**
> Right now they describe the old architecture item by item (`src/declarations/**`, `PointSession`,
> `defineModel(library, authoring)`, `state/modelRegistry` ...). If they are not changed,
> every subsequent new chat will be pulled off course by the old architecture — this is the most expensive pitfall in the whole process.

---

## Phase 0 · Starting point

**Goal**: an empty shell that starts with `npm run dev`, plus a set of AI context files pointing at the **new** architecture.
**Prerequisites**: none. Can run in parallel with or before/after Phase 1 (library); they do not depend on each other.

Dependency state confirmed: `plotly.js-cartesian-dist-min@4`, `comlink@4`, `shadcn-svelte@1.6`,
`clsx` / `tailwind-merge` / `tailwind-variants` / `tw-animate-css` /
`@lucide/svelte` / `@fontsource-variable/geist`, `sv-router@0.18`, and
`jsthermalcomfort` still symlinked to the fork. `npm run check` / `npm run lint` currently pass
(check only reports a "no svelte input files" warning, because `src/` has no `.svelte` yet).

> ADR §2 says pnpm. npm already works and the symlink is in effect; pnpm is a preference, not a requirement.
> If you want to switch, switch only at this step (`rm package-lock.json && pnpm import && pnpm i`);
> switching midway touches both the lockfile and the `file:` symlink semantics at once.

### 0.1–0.4 completed ✅

- `svelte.config.js`: removed the SvelteKit fragment appended by init (now identical to HEAD)
- `$lib` uniformly points at `src/` (`tsconfig.json` + `vite.config.js`); in `components.json` the
  `ui` alias is changed to `$lib/ui/primitives` and `utils` to `$lib/ui/primitives/cn`;
  `src/lib/` has been deleted, so there is no second set of aliases
- **`src/app.css` completed**: init only wrote the `@apply` block and was missing `@import "tailwindcss"` and
  all the colour tokens (`shadcn-svelte/tailwind.css` contains only keyframes and the custom variant,
  no tokens), so the build reported `Cannot apply unknown utility class 'border-border'`.
  The full `:root` / `.dark` / `@theme inline` has been generated from the shadcn registry's neutral base color
- `vite.config.js`: removed the dead flowbite code, `manualChunks` now points at `plotly.js-cartesian-dist-min`
- `tsconfig.json`: added `erasableSyntaxOnly` + `verbatimModuleSyntax`
- `.nvmrc` → 24, `engines.node` → `>=24`
- `npm test`: added `--passWithNoTests` (no test files during the skeleton period; once Phase 2 lands real tests the flag has no practical effect)
- `eslint.config.js` rewritten in full as the new architecture boundaries
- `src/main.ts` / `src/App.svelte` / the ADR §5 directory skeleton have been created
- `docs/adr-0001-architecture.md`, `docs/rewrite-plan.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`,
  `README.md` have been changed to point at the new architecture

**ESLint boundary rules have been tested in practice** (verified with deliberately violating probe files, deleted once run):

| Probe | Result |
|---|---|
| `src/core/*.ts` imports `svelte` | ✅ Error |
| `src/core/*.ts` contains the literal `"tdb"` / `"t_running_mean"` | ✅ Error (the key list is read from `io.quantities`; adding a quantity in the library needs no lint change) |
| `src/models/*.ts` imports `jsthermalcomfort/models` | ✅ No error (allowed since 2026-09-03: declaration files bind `run` and read metadata) |
| `src/state/*.ts` imports `jsthermalcomfort/models` | ✅ Error |
| `src/core/*.ts` imports `jsthermalcomfort/io` | ✅ No error (`io.quantities` is usable everywhere) |
| `src/ui/charts/*.svelte` imports a model | ✅ Error |
| `src/ui/outputs/*.svelte` uses `class="p-4 flex"` | ✅ Error |
| `src/ui/layout/*.svelte` uses `class="flex gap-2"` | ✅ No error (allowed) |
| `src/workers/*.ts` imports `jsthermalcomfort/models` | ✅ No error (allowed) |

> **ESLint flat config pitfall (hit once already)**: a rule of the same name in a later matching block **replaces** rather than merges.
> The first version wrote the `core/` boundary and the Tailwind restriction as separate blocks, and they were overwritten wholesale by the
> `no-restricted-imports` / `no-restricted-syntax` of a later block matching `src/**/*.{ts,svelte}`, **silently stopped working**, and the probes
> reported only 3 of 5. Now they are composed from fragment arrays, and every narrowing block repeats the fragments it still needs.
> **From now on, whenever a rule is added, write a probe first to verify it really errors**; do not assume it takes effect.

**Done criteria (met)**: all four of `npm run check` / `lint` / `build` / `test` pass.
`src/App.svelte` currently carries no Tailwind utility classes — it is a business component; spacing and the like
come from `Stack` / `Grid` / `Inline` once Phase 2's `ui/layout/` lands.

**Not yet done**: `git add` + commit (per the repository rules, git write operations are performed by you).

## Phase 1 · Library-side gaps (done in the fork repository, decoupled from the app)

> **Done in the fork, superseded by ADR-0002** (2026-09-13). The fork is abandoned; what the app still needs from this phase is re-homed by ADR-0002 decisions 2, 6, 9. History only.

**Goal**: fill the four gaps the app depends on: applicability-limit data (source, not mirror), standard membership,
the two missing quantities, and `psychrometricZone`'s operative mode. Only covers `pmv_ppd_iso` and `adaptive_ashrae`.
**Boundary**: the ADR §3 test. The library only adds things that "another tool would also need with exactly the same value"; steps, default values,
option copy, route path segments and `ModelDefinition` do not go into the library.
**Where**: `/Users/yehuihuang/SoftwareProjects/USYD/forked repo/jsthermalcomfort`,
branching `feat/applicability-limits` off `typescript`. The working tree has staged changes across 87 files
(deleting the docs theme, etc.); commit or stash first, then open the branch.
**Note**: the app consumes the build output `lib/esm/`, not `src/` — every library change needs
`npm run build` in the fork before the app sees it.

The whole block below can be pasted directly into a new chat (with cwd set to the fork repository):

````text
Repository: /Users/yehuihuang/SoftwareProjects/USYD/forked repo/jsthermalcomfort
Branch: open feat/applicability-limits from typescript (HEAD d57c456)
Reference: /Users/yehuihuang/SoftwareProjects/USYD/main repo/comfort-tool/docs/adr-0001-architecture.md, sections 3 and 4.1

Background: this library is a TypeScript port of pythermalcomfort and is a general-purpose library; the CBE Thermal
Comfort Tool being rewritten is only one of its consumers. The test: only add things that "another tool with a completely
different design, using the same model, would also need with exactly the same value". UI steps, default values, option copy, navigation grouping and registries do not go into the library.

[Already there, do not rebuild]

- Model function properties pmv_ppd_iso.{label,description,tsv},

                            adaptive_{ashrae,en}.{label,description,offsets}

[Five things to do]

1. Export the applicability limits as data, and make it the single source. Put it in src/reference/limits.ts
   (which currently holds only enCategoryPmvLimits).
   - Shape: readonly { quantity: Quantity; min: number; max: number }[],
     where quantity references the object in src/io/quantity.ts. Keyed by Quantity object, not by string.
   - Three tables:
     iso7730PmvLimits        tdb 10..30, tr 10..40, v and vr 0..1, met 0..4, clo 0..2
     ashrae55PmvLimits       tdb and tr 10..40, v and vr 0..2, met 1..4, clo 0..1.5
     ashrae55AdaptiveLimits  tdb and tr, v same as ASHRAE, t_running_mean 10..33.5
     Source of the numbers: _iso_compliance / _ashrae_compliance in src/utilities/utilities.ts,
     src/models/adaptive_ashrae.ts line 200. Do not write them from memory; check each one against the code.
   - Source, not mirror: change _iso_compliance / _ashrae_compliance and adaptive_ashrae line 200
     so they read min/max from the tables, and template the warning copy from the tables as well. Numeric results unchanged.
     First check whether tests/baseline.test.ts and tests/utilities/ pin the warning copy verbatim; if so, make the template
     reproduce it verbatim (the existing copy uses the character "ºC" and spellings like "10.0 and 33.5"; all of that must be preserved).
     This differs from the "Mirror, not source" of offsets.ts: offsets involve the t_cmf ± 3.5 inside the model kernel
     and are not touched this time; the limits live only in the check functions and can be made source.
   - ISO met lower bound: the code says 0, the docs say 0.8, the baseline pins 0. Write 0 in the table and record 0.8 in a comment.
     The comment near line 275 of utilities.ts already promises that limits.ts records this discrepancy; deliver on it this time.
   - Add assertions to tests/reference.test.ts: for every row of every table, feeding min - 0.01 and max + 0.01 to
     check_standard_compliance must produce a warning, and feeding min and max themselves must not.
   - Attach to the model functions: pmv_ppd_iso.limits, pmv_ppd_ashrae.limits, adaptive_ashrae.limits,
     the same pattern as .label / .tsv; the three tables are also exported from src/reference/index.ts.
   - Circular dependencies: models already import reference (bands / offsets), io/classes_return in turn
     imports models, and utilities is imported by models. limits.ts may only import the leaf module "../io/quantity.js",
     not "../io/index.js"; before utilities.ts imports limits.ts, first confirm that
     io/quantity.ts has only a type import of utilities (it does now), otherwise a cycle forms.

2. Export standard membership as data. Create src/reference/standards.ts:
   - export interface StandardRef { readonly id: string; readonly name: string }
   - export const standards = {
       iso7730:  { id: "iso7730",  name: "ISO 7730" },
       ashrae55: { id: "ashrae55", name: "ASHRAE 55" },
       en16798:  { id: "en16798",  name: "EN 16798-1" },
     } as const satisfies Record<string, StandardRef>
   - Attach to the model functions: pmv_ppd_iso.standard = standards.iso7730,
     pmv_ppd_ashrae.standard = standards.ashrae55, adaptive_ashrae.standard = standards.ashrae55,
     adaptive_en.standard = standards.en16798. Do not attach to set_tmp / two_nodes / cooling_effect / pmv_ppd.
   - Do not name it Standard: src/utilities/utilities.ts line 74 already has a Standard, which is
     the dispatch key of check_standard_compliance (including FAN_HEATWAVES, ANKLE_DRAFT); different semantics, do not merge.
   - Export standards and StandardRef from src/reference/index.ts.

3. Add two quantities to quantities in src/io/quantity.ts:
   - t_o: operative temperature, kind "temperature", key name aligned with the t_o of psychrometrics,
     label "Operative temperature", unit the same as tdb.
   - p_atm: atmospheric pressure, new kind "pressure" (add a member to the QuantityKind union type),
     label "Atmospheric pressure", siUnit "kPa"; ipUnit aligned with the existing pressure-branch convention in
     units_converter, or the same as SI if there is none.
   If the quantities count in the README is hard-coded, update it as well.

4. Add an operative mode to psychrometricZone. In src/charts/comfort_zone.ts, add
   readonly trFollowsDb?: boolean (default false) to PsychrometricZoneOptions.
   When true, the solver function calls pmv_ppd(db, db, vr, rh, met, clo, wme, standard, ...),
   i.e. tr follows db along the x axis; options.tr is ignored in that case, and the docs say so.
   This is the geometry of the CBE tool's psychtop chart; the old prototype's
   /Users/yehuihuang/SoftwareProjects/USYD/main repo/comfort-tool-old/src/declarations/pmv/calculation.ts
   line 77, psychrometricTrEqualsTdb, is exactly this switch.
   Add to tests/charts.test.ts: with trFollowsDb: true, recompute every solved vertex of the polygon with
   pmv_ppd(db, db, ...); the difference between |pmv| and pmvLimit must be within the order of epsilon.

5. Two pieces of housekeeping:
   - In src/utilities/index.ts, move Standard from the export type {} block to a value export
     (utilities.ts line 74 is a runtime constant; currently only the type escapes).
   - In src/utilities/index.ts, add the value export of valid_range (exported in the module, missing from the barrel).

[Do not do]
- Unit / step / toSi / fromSi, objectifying QuantityKind, InputSpec / OptionSpec / Band /
  OutputSpec, route path segments, ModelDefinition / models registry / evaluate(Map),
  defaultValue, adding id to offsets. All of these were assigned to the app in the 2026-09-03 boundary review (ADR §3 / §4.1.5).
- Do not change the signature or return value of any model function. tests/baseline.test.ts pins them byte for byte.
- Do not use enum / namespace / constructor parameter properties.

[Done criteria]
- npm run typecheck / lint / test all pass, and tests/baseline.test.ts passes with zero changes
- npm run build succeeds
- The boundary probe assertions in tests/reference.test.ts pass; the trFollowsDb assertion in tests/charts.test.ts passes;
  for every model with a standard attached, its standard is the same object as the member of reference.standards
- A 15-line node script can do: import { pmv_ppd_iso, io, charts } →
  read pmv_ppd_iso.standard.name → take the tdb range from pmv_ppd_iso.limits →
  io.pmvPpdIso({...}).toMeasures() → charts.psychrometricZone({ trFollowsDb: true, ... }),
  without a frontend existing at any point

## Phase 2 · Skeleton and the first usable screen

**Goal**: the Standard page, single slot, PMV (ISO 7730), input panel → result table, both SI/IP working. No charts.
**Prerequisites**: Phase 0 and Phase 1 both complete, and the fork has been through `npm run build`.

Build in order:

1. `src/core/` closed sets (ADR §4.2): `workspace.ts`, `chartType.ts` (both deferred to their first consumer, Phase 5 / Phase 3), `unitSystem.ts`,
   `entryModes.ts`. All are `as const` object collections + derived union types + plain `xxxFromId()` functions,
   written the same way as the library's `quantities`, with no classes. `temperatureMode` in `entryModes.ts` carries two
   Quantity fields, `panel` and `axis` (separate → `tdb`/`tr` and `tdb`, operative → `t_o` and `t_o`).
   `standard.ts`: a path-segment table keyed by the `reference.standards` objects + `pathSegmentFor` / `standardFromPath`.
2. `src/core/units.ts`: `DisplayUnit { symbol, step, toSi, fromSi }` +
   `displayUnitFor(quantity, unitSystem)`, looked up by `Quantity.kind`: temperature °C 0.1 / °F 0.1,
   airSpeed m/s 0.05 / fpm 10, percentage % 1, metabolicRate met 0.1, clothingInsulation clo 0.1,
   thermalSensation unitless 0.1, pressure kPa 0.1 / inHg 0.01. The conversion formulas are written here (the ADR §3 exception);
   `satisfies Record<QuantityKind, …>` guarantees a compile error here when the library adds a kind. Write the tests first: °C↔°F and m/s↔fpm round trips.
3. `src/core/modelDeclaration.ts`: `defineModel` + `RegisteredModel`. Fields: `run` (the library io wrapper),
   `model` (the library model function; reads label / description / standard / tsv / limits), `inputs` (order + default values),
   `table` (required), `charts`, `timeSeries`. The Standard capability is determined by whether `model.standard` exists.
4. `src/models/pmvIso.ts` (the shape from ADR §4.3) + `src/models/index.ts` (one registry line).
5. `src/core/numberFormat.ts`: at most two decimals, trailing zeros stripped (`26.0→26`, `78.80→78.8`). The only one in the whole project.
6. `src/core/libraryInputs.ts`: `toLibraryInputs(slot, model)` — converts the representations
   (Phase 2: relative humidity only — the other four need library-side inverses, see Phase 2b; operative mode) into the SI inputs the library wants, `Map<Quantity, number>` → library init
   (`Object.fromEntries` by `Quantity.key`, the only place in the app apart from shareLink that reads key),
   plus `v → vr` (whether to apply `v_relative`, checked against the old tool) and, under operative, expanding `t_o` into `tdb = tr = t_o`.
   Pure function; write the tests first.
7. `src/state/session.svelte.ts`: `Session` / `InputSlot` from ADR §4.5 (using only slot 0 for now).
8. `src/ui/inputs/` input panel + `src/ui/outputs/ResultTable.svelte` (the three sections of ADR §4.3:
   Input / Compliance / the outputs listed in the model's `table`). The panel shows the temperature rows according to `temperatureMode.panel`;
   labels are always `Quantity.label`, never copy such as "Air temperature".
9. `src/routes/navigation.ts` (the only place sv-router is used) + `/standard/iso-7730/pmv-iso/`.
10. SI/IP switching: the canonical stored state is always SI, only the displayed text is converted, and the step comes from the current display unit's `DisplayUnit.step`.

**Done criteria**
- Changing an input produces numbers immediately; no calculate button
- After an SI → IP → SI round trip the stored value is unchanged; the display shows at most two decimals and no trailing zeros
- Out of the hard range (`model.limits`): outlined in red, not calculated, last valid value kept
- Nothing in `core/` `import`s any `svelte` / `state` / `ui` (blocked by the lint rule)
- `numberFormat`, `units`, `toLibraryInputs` have unit tests

### Executed 2026-09-04 ✅

All done criteria met (`npm test` 21 tests, `check` / `lint` / `build` clean; verified in the browser against `io.pmvPpdIso` called directly). Decisions and findings made while executing:

| Item | Decision / finding |
|---|---|
| v → vr | **`v_relative(v, met)` is applied** (`relativeAirSpeed: true` in `models/pmvIso.ts`), matching the deployed CBE tool. `comfort-tool-old` passed the entered value straight through; enter `v_relative(v, met)` there when comparing numbers |
| Humidity | **RH only.** The library has no inverse conversions and no `hr` / `t_dp` / `t_wb` / `p_vap` quantities; `core/entryModes.ts` declares `humidityMode.rh` alone, `libraryInputs.ts` sets `rh` directly. The other four arrive with Phase 2b below |
| Compliance colour | `category` is drawn as a swatch coloured by **band position** from `core/bandPalette.ts` (the seven CBE fills `#0571b0 #4c78a8 #92c5de #f2f2f2 #f4a582 #e15759 #cc79a7`); `intervals` colour pass / fail. No label-string comparison anywhere |
| `limit_inputs` | Called with `false`: the app gates entered values against `model.limits` (red outline, no recompute, last valid result kept); the library then always returns numbers, as the deployed tool does |
| Range check | On the **entered** quantity only (`outOfRangeInputs`): `v` against its own row, not the derived `vr`; an operative `t_o` entry against the intersection of the `tdb` and `tr` rows |
| `$state.raw` | Identity-compared objects (model, unit system, entry modes, measures) must be `$state.raw`; a deep `$state` proxy made `session.unitSystem === unitSystem.si` false and the table show `—`. Now in ADR §6 / CLAUDE.md |
| Lint | `symbol:` properties are exempt from the wire-string rule (`met` / `clo` are unit symbols as well as keys); probe verified |
| Deferred | `workspace.ts`, `chartType.ts`, `xxxFromId()` wait for their first consumer (Phase 3 / Phase 5 shareLink); `environment` parameter of `toLibraryInputs` arrives with the humidity-ratio conversion |
| Library issue | `quantities.p_atm.siUnit` is `"kPa"` but `psy_ta_rh` and `psychrometricZone.p_atm` take Pa — resolve in the library before Phase 5 "Set pressure" (folded into Phase 2b) |
| Open | `rh` has no applicability row, so 0..100 is not enforced. Decide with Phase 2b whether a physical range belongs on `Quantity` or in `core/units.ts` by kind |

---

## Phase 2b · Library: humidity representations (fork repository)

> **Done in the fork, superseded by ADR-0002** (2026-09-13). The four inverse functions are re-submitted as a PR to the main repository (ADR-0002 decision 10) and are the prerequisite for the switch. History only.

**Goal**: the four remaining humidity representations, so `humidityMode` can grow to five and `toLibraryInputs` can convert them without the app writing a formula or a root finder (ADR §3).
**Prerequisites**: none on the app side; run in a separate chat with cwd set to the fork. Afterwards `npm run build` in the fork, then in the app: add the four modes to `core/entryModes.ts`, the four conversions to `core/libraryInputs.ts`, a mode selector row to `ui/inputs/InputPanel.svelte`, and the `pressure` / `humidityRatio` display units in `core/units.ts` (the `satisfies Record<QuantityKind, …>` will demand them).

> **Library side done** (fork `43d7e92`). **App side outstanding**: Phase 3 added only the `humidityRatio` display unit,
> because without it `core/units.ts` no longer compiled — the `satisfies Record<QuantityKind, …>` did exactly its job. The
> other three items move to **Phase 3.6**.

````text
Repository: /Users/yehuihuang/SoftwareProjects/USYD/forked repo/jsthermalcomfort, branch typescript (HEAD 1f4df79)
Reference: comfort-tool/docs/adr-0001-architecture.md §3 / §4.1

Test as always: "would pythermalcomfort ship it?" Inverse psychrometric conversions are general-purpose; UI copy, steps and defaults are not.

1. Add four quantities to src/io/quantity.ts:
   hr    kind "humidityRatio" (new QuantityKind member), label "Humidity ratio", siUnit "kg/kg", ipUnit "kg/kg"
   t_dp  kind "temperature", label "Dew-point temperature", °C / °F
   t_wb  kind "temperature", label "Wet-bulb temperature", °C / °F
   p_vap kind "pressure", label "Water vapour partial pressure" — unit must match what the functions return/accept (see 3)
2. Add to src/psychrometrics/ (each a pure function, SI only, no rounding beyond what p_sat already does):
   rh_from_humidity_ratio(hr, tdb, p_atm)   inverse of psy_ta_rh().hr  (p_vap = hr·p_atm / (0.62198 + hr); rh = 100·p_vap / p_sat(tdb))
   rh_from_dew_point(t_dp, tdb)             rh = 100·p_sat(t_dp) / p_sat(tdb); t_dp ≥ tdb → 100
   rh_from_wet_bulb(t_wb, tdb, p_atm)       numeric inverse of psy_ta_rh().t_wb using the existing bisect in src/charts/root_finding.ts (move it to a shared internal module if importing across layers is awkward)
   rh_from_vapour_pressure(p_vap, tdb)      rh = 100·p_vap / p_sat(tdb)
   Clamp to [0, 100]. Export from src/psychrometrics/index.ts (named + default object).
3. Resolve the pressure unit inconsistency: quantities.p_atm.siUnit is "kPa" but psy_ta_rh and PsychrometricZoneOptions.p_atm take Pa. Pick one (recommend siUnit "Pa" so quantity and function agree) and apply it to p_vap too.
4. Tests (tests/psychrometrics.test.ts): for a grid of (tdb, rh, p_atm) round-trip every inverse through psy_ta_rh to within the precision p_sat's 1-dp rounding allows; document that bound.
5. Do not add: steps, defaults, labels for UI modes, anything keyed by string.
Done: npm run typecheck / lint / test / build pass; tests/baseline.test.ts unchanged.

## Phase 3 · Charts

**Goal**: both the psychrometric chart and the dynamic chart render, and Explore's 100×100 grid does not freeze the UI.
**Prerequisites**: Phase 2.

1. `src/core/charts/chartSpec.ts`: `ChartSpec { traces, layout, shapes, legend }`,
   `LegendEntry { label, swatch, color }`.
2. `src/ui/charts/PlotlyChart.svelte`: mounted via `{@attach}`, **consumes only a `ChartSpec`, imports no model**.
3. `src/ui/charts/ChartLegend.svelte`: **the whole chart has exactly one legend, always below the chart**;
   Plotly's built-in legend is turned off (`layout.showlegend = false`). When exporting an image, the same `legend` data
   generates a horizontal bottom Plotly legend, so screen and export stay consistent.
4. `src/core/charts/psychrometricChart.ts`: calls `charts.psychrometricZone` with
   `rhStep: 5` (Decided: reproduce the old chart). The x-axis quantity is taken from
   `temperatureMode.axis`, the axis label is `Quantity.label`; operative mode passes `trFollowsDb: true`.
   **Do not write your own root finder**.
5. `src/core/charts/dynamicChart.ts`: selectable x/y quantities, 100×100 grid.
6. `src/workers/compute.worker.ts` + Comlink; the main thread discards stale results by stamp.
   Trigger point: ADR §4.7's own data says PMV with cooling effect is 43 µs per call → 100×100 = 0.43 s,
   so run synchronously before this step and wire up the Worker only once it measurably stalls — first have a chart that draws, then talk about async.
7. Three things for plotly 4.0: `config.showSendToCloud = false` and a trimmed modebar;
   colours uniformly hex + `rgba()` (culori no longer accepts fractional `rgb()`); do not install `@types/plotly.js`.

**Done criteria**
- The PMV psychrometric chart's comfort-zone vertices differ from the old tool (`../comfort-tool-old/`) by ≤ 0.01 °C under the same inputs (the app applies `v_relative(v, met)`; enter that `vr` in the old tool first)
- Any chart has exactly one legend, below the chart; Plotly's built-in legend never appears
- Zoom/pan work; when the grid calculation takes > 300 ms, show "computing" and keep the old chart

### Executed 2026-09-04 ✅

Both charts render; `npm test` 43 tests, `check` / `lint` / `build` clean. Decisions and findings:

| Item | Decision / finding |

| Worker | **Skipped, as this phase's own step 6 instructs.** Measured: zone 1.7 ms, 100×100 ISO grid 21 ms, and 26–31 ms end to end in the browser from an input change to the redraw. Far under the 300 ms threshold, so the "computing" indicator never fires either. Both are reinstated in Phase 3.7 — see the ASHRAE measurement there |
| Vertex accuracy | Verified against an **independent bisection oracle written in the test**, not against the running old tool: every one of the 21 cool-edge vertices is within 0.01 °C, separate and operative alike. Running `comfort-tool-old` side by side is still outstanding and moves to Phase 3.5 |
| Oracle rounding | The first oracle used `io.pmvPpdIso`'s default `round_output: true` and reported 0.030 °C. A rounded PMV is a staircase of 0.01 steps ≈ a 0.03 °C plateau, so any point in it looks like a root. The library's solver calls with `round_output: false`; the oracle now does too. The result table shows the rounded PMV, the zone is solved unrounded — as the deployed tool does |
| Operative mode bug | A remembered `tdb` axis survived the switch to operative entry, where the slot only holds `t_o`: the axis select went blank and the whole field collapsed to one band. Fixed with `underTemperatureMode(quantity, mode)` in `core/entryModes.ts`, plus a regression test |
| Viewport | `layout.uirevision` keyed on axis titles and ranges: an input change redraws inside the zoom the user set, a unit or axis change resets it |
| Image export | Plotly's `toImage` button removed — its PNG would come out without the legend, which lives below the chart. Proper export is Phase 5 |
| Rendering | Shipped as a `heatmap`. **Wrong** — ADR §4.4 says contour, and it is why the bands look stepped. Corrected in Phase 3.5 |
| Axis ranges | Taken from `model.limits`, which clipped the ISO chart to 10–30 °C and left `rh` unable to carry an axis. **Wrong** — corrected in Phase 3.5 |

## Phases 3.5 – 3.7 · Contract freeze before the Phase 4 acceptance

Inserted 2026-09-04 after the post-Phase-3 scope review. The reasoning is one sentence: **Phase 4's acceptance asserts
that adding a model touches two files, which only means something once the contracts have stopped moving.** Every known
change to the shape of `RegisteredModel`, `ChartDeclaration` or `ChartSpec` therefore lands here, before the acceptance —
and after it, none should be needed. The three phases are split by the files they touch, so they barely overlap.

### Phase 3.5 · Chart contract and rendering

Everything in `core/charts/` and `ui/charts/`.

1. Axis ranges move into the model declaration, defaulting to the ranges the deployed tool draws; `model.limits` goes back
   to validating input only (ADR §4.4). The psychrometric viewport becomes 10–40 °C at 121 samples, matching
   `comfort-tool-old`'s `charts/psychrometric/humidity.ts:18`.
2. A `zones` source on the dynamic declaration, so a model can supply exact polygons. **This is the one field added before
   its consumer exists** — Phase 4's Adaptive is that consumer, and adding it here is what keeps Phase 4 at two files.
3. `ChartSpec` gains a per-trace hover mode and `annotations`; hover stops snapping (ADR §4.4), and the RH isolines get
   their 10 %–100 % labels back.
4. `heatmap` → `contour`.
5. Both axis selects offer every entered quantity and exclude the one the other holds.
6. Then run the deferred behaviour comparison: `cd ../comfort-tool-old && npm i && npm run dev`, and compare the result
   table, the zone vertices and an SI/IP round trip item by item. This is the moment for it — the geometry has just settled.

### Executed 2026-09-05 ✅

All six steps landed; `npm test` 49 tests, `check` / `lint` / `build` clean. Decisions and findings:

| Item | Decision / finding |
|---|---|
| Axis ranges | Moved to the model declaration, then **moved again to model level**: `RegisteredModel.axisRanges` is one `[quantity, min, max]` table both charts read. Per-chart ranges were implemented first, exactly as ADR §4.4 specified, and produced `10, 40` four times in one file for a flexibility nothing in v1 or in the deployed tool uses — `comfort-tool-old` feeds one `pmvIndoorTemperatureRangeSi` constant to the psychrometric chart, the field chart and the operative axis alike. Model level also makes the psychrometric x range follow the entry mode for free. ADR §4.4 was corrected to match |
| Viewport | 10–40 °C at 121 isoline samples, humidity ratio 0–0.03, matching `comfort-tool-old`'s `charts/psychrometric/humidity.ts:18`. `model.limits` no longer touches any chart |
| `zones` | `(request: ZoneRequest) => ZonePolygon[]` on the dynamic declaration, handed the slot's resolved SI values and the drawn x extent so Phase 4's Adaptive can call `charts.adaptiveAshraeZone({ v, trmRange })` without new plumbing. The one field added before its consumer exists; a synthetic declaration in `dynamicChart.test.ts` stands in for that consumer until Phase 4 |
| Hover | Per-trace `hover: "off" \| "field"` on `ChartSpec`. Chrome — isolines, zone outline, slot markers — stops capturing the pointer; the contour answers per cell and a zone polygon answers anywhere inside its fill (`hoveron: "fills"`). **The transparent probe layer ADR §4.4 asks for is deferred to Phase 5**, so the psychrometric chart currently has no cursor readout at all. Decided rather than drifted: the deployed tool's readout box is a Phase 5c interface concern |
| Annotations | `ChartSpec.annotations`; the RH isolines are labelled 10 %–100 % where each curve leaves the top of the viewport. The `%` comes from the display unit, not from a literal |
| `heatmap` → `contour` | Done, with `contours: { start: -0.5, end: n - 0.5, size: 1 }` so band index *k* owns its own step |
| Axis selects | Both offer every entered quantity (`rh` included, which the limits-derived version could not) and each excludes the quantity the other holds. A second collision path was found and fixed: the entry mode maps both `tdb` and `tr` onto `operative_tmp`, so a `tdb × tr` chart collapsed onto one quantity. `resolvedAxes()` is now the single place both the chart and the select resolve axes through |
| Step 6, the deferred comparison | **`comfort-tool-old` cannot run.** It resolves `jsthermalcomfort` through the same symlink as this app, and the fork's `typescript` branch no longer exports what it imports (`clo_tout`); the published 1.4.0 does not have what it needs either (`pmv_ppd_iso.tsv.bins`). Running it would mean rebuilding the fork on an older branch, which breaks this app. Compared against **the deployed tool's own `comfort-models.js`** instead — the draft was only ever its replica — with these results |
| Result table parity | `comf.pmvEN` vs `io.pmvPpdIso` over eight input sets including the app's defaults: worst \|Δpmv\| **2.6e-14**, worst \|Δppd\| **8.1e-13** |
| Zone parity | Every one of the 42 cool/warm-edge vertices, fed back through the deployed tool's own PMV: worst \|PMV − target\| **4.6e-4**, against the library's 1e-3 solver residual |
| SI/IP round trip | `units.test.ts` plus a browser pass: 25 °C → 77 °F, 0.1 m/s → 19.69 fpm, viewport 50–104 °F, ISO input range 50–86 °F |

## Library alignment with pythermalcomfort · 2026-09-05

Unplanned, inserted between 3.5 and 3.6. It began as one question about a single field and ended as the first full audit
of the fork against upstream.

**How it started.** Phase 3.5's psychrometric declaration carried `pmvVariant: "ISO"`, the string
`charts.psychrometricZone` needs to pick a PMV formulation. The question "why does the app have to say that, when
`pmv_ppd_iso` already hard-codes it?" traced back to upstream commit `61de959`, which **deleted** the combined
`pmv_ppd(…, standard)` and replaced the switch with two functions. The fork had followed that in its `io` layer and not
in `models/` or `charts/`, so `pmvVariant` was a legacy switch surfacing two layers up. The string
`standard: "ISO" | "ASHRAE"` turned out to be the probe: everywhere it survived, the same migration was unfinished.

**What the audit covered.** The fork's whole public surface — 8 models, 12 psychrometrics, 13 utilities, plus
`reference` / `io` / `charts` — compared against upstream on equations, parameters, applicability and naming. Confirmed
identical and not touched: `adaptive_ashrae` and `adaptive_en` (slopes, offsets, cooling effect, acceptability),
`cooling_effect` (brent 0–40, still-air 0.1), the three `airspeed_control` conditions, `v_relative`, `f_svv`,
`body_surface_area`, `running_mean_outdoor_temperature`, `units_converter`, and every psychrometric equation.

**What was wrong (fork commit `3292f0b`).**

| Finding | Fix |
|---|---|
| `clo_dynamic(clo, met, "ISO")` applied the ASHRAE formula with the threshold moved to met > 1. Upstream's `clo_dynamic_iso` is the ISO 9920:2007 Annex C correction and takes `v` and `i_a` — a different equation, not a different threshold | Split into `clo_dynamic_ashrae` / `clo_dynamic_iso` |
| ISO `met` lower limit was `0`; jsthermalcomfort 1.4.0 checked `value < 0` while printing "between 0.8 and 4.0", so it never fired | `0.8`, as upstream. The app's input panel now shows the real range |
| ISO applicability also bounds the **derived** `p_vap ≤ 2700 Pa` and the **output** `pmv ∈ [−2, 2]`. The library enforced both internally but `.limits` — the table every consumer reads — did not carry them | Both are rows now, and `io.quantities` gained `p_vap`. **The app still ignores them**: `outOfRangeInputs` only walks entered quantities. Carried into Phase 3.6 below |
| `ashraeThermalSensation` was right-closed while ISO's was left-closed, so the two standards would label PMV = −0.5 differently. Upstream publishes no ASHRAE sensation scale at all | Left-closed, with the reasoning recorded in the library |
| `pmv_ppd` still publicly exported; `psychrometricZone` still took a `standard` string defaulting to `"ASHRAE"` | `pmv_ppd` is internal; the zone takes the model function, required, no default. `pmvVariant` disappeared from the app |
| No edition concept. Upstream's `pmv_ppd_iso` defaults to **7730-2025** and also accepts 7730-2005 | Added as `edition` — not upstream's `model`, which already means something else here. Verified: upstream runs both editions through the same kernel, so no number moves |
| `two_nodes`, and the psychrometric function names, were 1.4.0's vocabulary tracking an older upstream | Renamed to `two_nodes_gagge`, `operative_tmp`, `mean_radiant_tmp`, `wet_bulb_tmp`, `dew_point_tmp`, `enthalpy_air`, `hr_to_rh`, occurrence by occurrence, and followed through this app |
| Only 2 of the shared `validation-data-comfort-models` fixtures were subscribed, for 8 shipped models; `set_tmp` and `two_nodes` had no upstream conformance check at all | Six fixtures now, `VALIDATION_DATA_REF` pinned to `v1.0.0`. 192 model tests pass |
| `set_tmp` carried a `units` parameter upstream had removed; `two_nodes` computed a percent-satisfied value it never returned; `psy_ta_rh`'s doc example showed a negative humidity ratio and a negative enthalpy | All three corrected |

**The rule this produced**, now ADR §3: the fork follows upstream's logic *and* naming by default, and deviates only
where TypeScript requires it, with the reason at the site. Kept deliberately: the kwargs object (TS has no keyword
arguments), `reference/` as public data, the `io` layer, `charts/`, and `psychrometrics/` as its own module.

Fork: 633 tests. App: 49 tests, `check` / `lint` / `build` clean, and the working brief is kept at the fork's
`ALIGNMENT-BRIEF.md`.

Since then (2026-09-06) the fork folded its pending breaking cleanups into the unreleased major (`46e8a0c`: ESM only;
`io` outcomes expose the raw values as `readonly result`). The app's one affected site, the `pmvAt()` oracle in
`psychrometricChart.test.ts`, followed.

### Phase 3.6 · Input contract and panel

Everything in `core/entryModes.ts`, `core/libraryInputs.ts`, `core/modelDeclaration.ts`, `ui/inputs/`.

1. Entry groups. Today `libraryInputs.ts` injects `rh` unconditionally,
   which would hand Adaptive — whose inputs are `tdb / tr / t_running_mean / v` — a quantity it does not take.
   **Decided 2026-09-08: no `entryGroups` field.** A model has the humidity group when its `inputs` name `q.rh`
   and the temperature group when they name `q.tdb` and `q.tr`; `InputSlot`'s constructor already reads the first,
   and every v1 model (PMV, Adaptive, UTCI) is covered. `RegisteredModel` does not change.
2. The four remaining humidity entry modes, finishing Phase 2b's app side. Decided 2026-09-08 with it: `p_atm` is
   omitted (library default 101325 Pa) until the "Set pressure" calculator brings `environment`; the SI pressure
   display unit becomes kPa via `/1000`, because the library's `p_vap` / `p_atm` are in Pa while `core/units.ts`
   had been treating its kPa symbol as identity — harmless while nothing displayed a pressure.
   Landed in `src/core/entryModes.ts`, `src/core/libraryInputs.ts`, and `src/ui/inputs/InputPanel.svelte`
   (`docs/specs/2026-09-08-humidity-entry-modes-design.md` is the landing note).
3. `OptionSpec` / `OptionValue`, `RegisteredModel.options`, `InputSlot.options`. **Decided 2026-09-07: toggle only in
   v1.** The one consumer is Phase 3.7's ASHRAE `airspeed_control`; a `choice` kind waits for a second. The ISO
   **edition** the library gained on 2026-09-05 (`"7730-2005"` / `"7730-2025"`) is *not* an option: both editions run
   the same kernel over the same limits, so a selector would offer two names for one number. Instead
   `src/models/pmvIso.ts` pins `edition: "7730-2005"` in `run`, and the result table names it. 2005 rather than
   upstream's 2025 default because the kernel keeps the pre-2025 `t_cla` initial guess for parity with the deployed CBE
   tool (upstream's 2025 Annex D form moves PMV by up to 5.1e-3; `pmv_ppd.ts` says why), so 2005 is the edition the
   numbers actually follow; when the library one day implements a real 2025 difference, the app switches by an
   explicit diff instead of drifting under an unchanged label. Library side (L2): `PmvPpdInit` accepts `edition` and
   `PmvPpdIsoOutputs` echoes it, so a result can say which edition it was computed under.
   **Landed 2026-09-07 (fork c41bc95, app b2a9e1f): the edition half** — the fork's `PmvPpdIsoInit.edition` /
   `PmvPpdIsoOutputs.edition`, with `PMV_PPD_ISO_DEFAULT_EDITION` (`@internal`) and `assert_pmv_ppd_iso_edition`;
   the app's `RegisteredModel.edition`, `src/models/pmvIso.ts` pinning `"7730-2005"` in `run`, and the result table's
   edition caption. `OptionSpec` itself is still open.
   **2026-09-15: moved to Phase 4b.** The edition half now lives in ADR-0002's shape: `RegisteredModel.edition` went with
   C4, the declaration's `standard: Standard.iso_7730_2005` is the pin, and `core/standard.ts` generates the year the result
   table captions. `OptionSpec` / `RegisteredModel.options` / `InputSlot.options` wait for their first consumer,
   `airspeed_control`, which is Phase 4b item 1; building the field before it would contradict the rule this plan applies
   everywhere else (a field waits for its first consumer). Toggle-only stands and is re-checked with the model on screen.
   This item is no longer a Phase 4 prerequisite.
4. **The three kinds of applicability** (handed over by the library alignment). `pmv_ppd_iso.limits` now carries rows for
   the derived `p_vap ≤ 2700 Pa` and the output `pmv ∈ [−2, 2]` beside the entered quantities, and `outOfRangeInputs`
   walks entered quantities only, so both are silently ignored — the same hole the library just closed. They cannot
   simply join the existing gate either: its semantics are "input out of range → do not calculate, keep the last valid
   result", which is wrong for an output bound. A PMV of 2.4 must be *shown*, flagged as outside ISO 7730's
   applicability. So: entered → correctable, blocks calculation; derived → reported against the inputs that produced it;
   output → shown with a caveat. This is the Compliance column's business as much as the input panel's.
   **Decided 2026-09-07: the library reports, the app only displays.** Library side (L1): `Outcome.violations:
   readonly ApplicabilityLimit[]` — every limit row the call broke, computed whatever `limit_inputs` says, input rows
   first and the ISO-only derived / output rows last (the order `tests/baseline.test.ts` already pins); `warnings`
   stays, as `violations.map((v) => v.warning)`, so no string moves; NaN-ing remains gated by `limit_inputs`; the
   public `pmv_ppd_iso` keeps returning `{ pmv, ppd }` as upstream's does, and the field lives on the fork's own `io`
   layer. App side: `outOfRangeInputs` keeps gating entered values *before* the call; after it, `violations` is split
   by `role` — `derived`, and an `input` row for a quantity the user did not enter (`v` in range while
   `vr = v + 0.3(met − 1)` is not), → one hint line under the input panel, `limit.warning` verbatim, which also retires
   the `ponytail:` note in `libraryInputs.ts`; `output` → the result is shown as it is and the Compliance column carries
   the caveat. Rejected: the app computing `rh × 10 × antoine(tdb)` itself (ADR §3, and `psy_ta_rh().p_vap` is a
   different equation from the one the check uses); `limit_inputs: true` plus string `warnings` (NaN as a sentinel,
   strings matched back to rows); leaving both rows unread until after the Phase 4 acceptance, which is meant to test
   a frozen `Outcome`.
   **Landed 2026-09-07 (fork c41bc95, app b2a9e1f):** the fork's `range_violations` (the `@internal` primitive
   `_range_warnings` now maps over), the kernel evaluating the ISO derived and output rows on every call with
   `limit_inputs` still gating only the NaN-ing, `Outcome.violations` on all four `io` outcomes, and
   `en16798AdaptiveLimits` published as `adaptive_en.limits` with `ComplianceKwargs.t_running_mean` to range-check it;
   the app's `Outputs.violations`, the input panel's hint line and the result table's caveat — both filtering by
   `role` inline, which also retired the `ponytail:` note in `libraryInputs.ts`. `standard_violations` was cut on
   2026-09-07 (a second dispatcher with one caller; the kernel now picks the table in one line), and so was
   `core/applicability.ts`: two one-line `.filter()` calls do not earn a module.
5. A free-entry input that also offers a searchable preset list, fed by the library's `met_typical_tasks` and, for `clo`,
   its typical ensembles.
   **Decided 2026-09-15** (spec `.scratch/presets-and-model-select/spec.md`; ADR-0002 decision 20):
   - *Data.* `met` offers the 31 typical tasks; `clo` offers the 9 ASHRAE typical ensembles — the deployed tool's two lists.
     `clo_individual_garments` is not a preset list: it is the data of the Phase 5b custom-ensemble calculator, and this item
     as first written named the wrong table.
   - *Home.* Presets hang off the Quantity, not the declaration. No model wants a different `met` list, so `core/presets.ts`
     binds `met` and `clo` to their library tables once and `presetsFor(quantity)` answers for every model; a declaration
     field (ADR-0001 §4.3's `presets`) would be copied verbatim into every PMV declaration. The binding reads the tables'
     keys, a §4.0 rule 2 boundary read like `core/standard.ts` reading `Object.keys(Standard)`.
   - *Control.* A searchable list composed from shadcn-generated primitives (`command`, `popover`; bits-ui is already installed),
     not a native `<datalist>`, which is unreliable on `type="number"`. The box always holds the number, converted with the unit system; a preset whose value
     matches is named beside it. Selecting a preset commits its number through the existing `oncommit(si)`. A preset is
     never state: the slot, the session and the share link know only the number.
   - *Labels.* The list shows the library's keys. Today those are identifiers (`Seated_Cquiet`, `Walking_2mph_3_2kmh`)
     where pythermalcomfort's are human strings ("Seated, quiet"), and `clo_typical_ensembles` is a `switch` function whose
     `.d.ts` omits the 0.57 ensemble. Both are fixed upstream, in the checkout the app links to: `met_typical_tasks` keys
     aligned with pythermalcomfort and typed; the ensembles exported as a table. The app transcribes no label and no number.
     pythermalcomfort keys all three tables with human strings and publishes the ensembles as a dict (verified 2026-09-15),
     so this is parity, not a design question; the rename is breaking for JS consumers and the PR says so. If rejected at
     review, the fallback is an upstream labelled export, not an app-side table; if that stalls too, this item moves behind
     Phase 4, which enters no `met` or `clo` and does not depend on it.
   **Landed 2026-09-17 (`1f0fa93` core presets, `984b30b` preset input).**
6. A model dropdown at the top of the input panel, listing only the models of the standard the page is on, sharing
   `navigateTo(model)` with the left navigation, which stays.
   **Decided 2026-09-15** (same spec). It lives in `StandardPage`, above `InputPanel`, which stays a slot editor with no
   knowledge of routes; `routes/navigation.ts` gains `modelsOf(standard)`, the one derivation the left navigation and the
   dropdown share; the generated `select` primitive is reused. Shown even when the list has one entry — ISO 7730 has one
   model for all of v1 — so the layout does not jump when Phase 4b puts two under ASHRAE 55. Acceptance: a unit test that
   `modelsOf` keeps a model with no `standard` out (Heat Index's shape), plus a browser pass. Heat Index is on no page in
   Phase 4 — it has no standard and Explore is Phase 5 — so the Phase 4 acceptance stays the four scripts and `git diff --stat`.
   **Landed 2026-09-16 (`77dbc07`).**
7. **Visual groundwork — not the design itself.** `app.css` gains the project's own tokens (a type scale, a spacing
   scale, a brand colour) instead of the shadcn neutral base it ships with today, and the primitives the app actually
   needs are generated: `select` (which replaces the native one Phase 3 hand-rolled in `ChartControls.svelte`), `card`,
   `separator`. Layout structure is deliberately untouched. Doing this here is what stops every later phase from
   improvising its own CSS: Phase 3 already had to, twice.
   **Landed 2026-09-08, narrower than written.** Tailwind 4 already ships a type scale and a spacing scale, so the
   app declares neither: `app.css` gains only what it lacked — `--brand`, a placeholder that `--primary` follows until
   Phase 5c picks the colour, and `--font-size-caption`, which the four business components that had each written
   `0.75rem` by hand now reference — and loses the `.dark` block and the `--sidebar-*` / `--chart-*` variables no v1
   code reads. Only `select` was generated (the CLI pulled `separator` in as its dependency); `card` waits for its
   first consumer, because wrapping the columns in one is a design decision and this item is not the design.

### Phase 3.7 · PMV (ASHRAE 55) + the Worker

> **Blocked since 2026-09-13**: the main repository has no `PMV_PPD_ASHRAE_INFO` yet (ADR-0002 decision 13). This phase moves behind the ADR-0002 migration and Phase 4 as **Phase 4b**; the Worker and the `compute.svelte.ts` rewrite (items 2–3) still belong to it.
>
> **2026-09-21**: item 2 is withdrawn and item 3 moves forward (ADR-0002 decision 29). At `GRID = 51` the ASHRAE scan below is 88 ms, so v1 has no Worker, Comlink, stamp or "computing" indicator. The `compute.svelte.ts` redesign is no longer tied to going async: it is Phase 4 prerequisite 4, as synchronous derivation.

1. `src/models/pmvAshrae.ts` + one registry line — **the first architecture acceptance**, and the thing that proves the
   `options` contract carries a real model.
2. The Worker becomes mandatory here. Measured 2026-09-04, 100×100 grid: ISO 21 ms, **ASHRAE 340 ms** — the cooling effect
   costs 16× per point. So this phase delivers ADR §4.7 in full: `workers/compute.worker.ts`, Comlink, the stale-result
   stamp, and the "computing" indicator past 300 ms.
3. `state/compute.svelte.ts` is rewritten in the same pass. It currently assigns to state inside an `$effect` and reaches
   for `untrack` to break the loop it thereby creates — the exact pattern Svelte's Best practices names ("avoid updating
   state inside effects"), and a violation of the ADR's own §6. Going async is the natural moment to fix it. Keeping the
   last valid result across an out-of-range input is genuinely stateful, so this is a redesign, not a substitution.
4. Library side, upstream in the main repository (the fork is gone): `suppressWarnings` on `BaseInputsInit`. **Still outstanding** — the 2026-09-05 alignment
   round did not cover it; `charts.psychrometricZone` has `suppressModelWarnings`, the `io` inputs do not. One ASHRAE grid scan logs 300 "Assuming cooling
   effect = 0" lines; `charts.psychrometricZone` already silences its own trace and any field-drawing consumer needs the
   same (ADR §3).

### Done criteria for 3.5 – 3.7

- The four scripts pass after each phase.
- After 3.7, a full pass over [code-quality-checklist.md](code-quality-checklist.md) — the last point at which a contract
  may still change shape.
- `RegisteredModel`, `ChartDeclaration` and `ChartSpec` are not expected to change again until Phase 5.

## Phase 4 · Second model ← architecture acceptance, do not proceed if it fails

**Passed 2026-09-22 (`e53a07a`) ✅ — acceptance: two files, test count unchanged (136).**

**Goal**: add **Heat Index (Rothfusz)** — `heat_index_rothfusz` with `HEAT_INDEX_ROTHFUSZ_INFO`, the one other model whose `_INFO` the main repository ships today (rewritten 2026-09-13, ADR-0002 decision 13; it was Adaptive (ASHRAE 55), which now waits for its `_INFO` in Phase 4b).
**Prerequisites**:
1. The ADR-0002 migration — **done 2026-09-15** (`9c6df55`; the app is on the main repository's interface, the four scripts green).
2. **The `ModelResult` contract — done 2026-09-15 (`c5f8ba6`).** The 2026-09-15 dry run (ticket 06) registered Heat Index with the straight declaration and one registry line: `test`, `lint` and `build` passed, `check` failed with three errors. `core/modelDeclaration.ts` types `run`'s return as `ModelResult = Readonly<Record<string, number | string>>`, and the library's `HeatIndexResult` is an `interface` with no index signature, so it is not assignable; `PmvPpdIso` only passes because it is a JSDoc typedef alias, which gets the implicit index signature. Separately, `src/models/index.ts` is an `as const` tuple, so `routes/navigation.ts`'s `standardModels()` reads `model.standard` off the element union and errors on a member without `standard`; the registry must be typed `readonly RegisteredModel[]`. Both are `core/` and registry changes and are made as their own commit *before* Phase 4, so the acceptance diff stays at two files. Spreading the result object in the declaration (`({ ...heat_index_rothfusz(...) })`) made all four scripts pass with two files touched — which proves every layer below the type boundary takes a second model unchanged — but it is a workaround and is rejected. Fixed by widening `ModelResult` to `object` with the single string-keyed read in `libraryInputs.resultValue`, and typing the registry `readonly RegisteredModel[]`; the dry run re-run touched only the two files.
3. **Phase 3.6 items 5 and 6 — done 2026-09-17.** Decided 2026-09-15, spec and tickets in `.scratch/presets-and-model-select/` (item 3 moved to Phase 4b the same day); items 5 and 6 landed as `1f0fa93`, `984b30b` and `77dbc07`. The Heat Index two-file dry run was re-run against the result: all four scripts green, `git diff --stat` at exactly two files.
4. **The numeric scan and the model name — added 2026-09-21, done 2026-09-22.** (ADR-0002 decisions 27–30; spec and tickets in `.scratch/numeric-scan-and-model-name/`). Both change the declaration's shape, which is cheapest while there is one model file. Seven tickets: (01) the route lookup moves out of the router module, a prefactor; (02) `name: "pmv_ppd_iso"` replaces `pathSegment`, the route segment is generated from it, `pmvIso` becomes `pmvPpdIso`, and tests prove the name against the package's exports and its uniqueness; (03) the dynamic chart's `output` names the number and `bands` its classifier, the grid keeps the number, and a drift test pins `classifyFromBins(result[output], bands)` to the kernel's category; (04) `GRID = 51`, blocked by 03; (05) `state/compute.svelte.ts` is redesigned as synchronous derivation under new state-level tests, and the unused `comlink` dependency goes; (07) the band-position remap of 03 is replaced by one constraint contour per Band on the number itself, written after 03 measured the remap's error at an Edge between unequal intervals; (06) the Heat Index dry run is re-run with the new shape and this prerequisite is marked done. 01, 03 and 05 start in parallel. The page looks as it does today, with smoother band edges. **Landed `f74ce9a`, `e137a65` + `1cd48bc`, `319c1af`, `042c0f7`, `b76bdba`, `19590ca` + `7651f06`; the dry run is the 2026-09-22 position above.**
5. **`run` reads its values by `Quantity` — added 2026-09-22, done 2026-09-22 (`1dfc37f`).** (ADR-0002 decision 34; ticket 12 in `.scratch/numeric-scan-and-model-name/`.) `run` is `(values) => result` with `values(...quantities)` spread at the head of the library's positional call; `Record<string, number>` and `core/libraryInputs.ts`'s `keyedInputs` are gone, the psychrometric chart's PMV closure passes a `Map<Quantity, number>`, and a registry-wide test proves the order of the quantities against the library function's parameter names — proven red by swapping `tdb` and `tr`, which `npm run check` does not see. `toLibraryInputs` keeps its name and returns the reader, so `state/compute.svelte.ts` and the dynamic chart needed no edit. The Heat Index dry run was repeated on the new shape (`heat_index_rothfusz(...values(q.tdb, q.rh), { round: false, … })`): four scripts green, `git diff --stat` at exactly the declaration file and the registry line.

Why this model is a fair test: two inputs (`tdb`, `rh`) so it has the humidity group without the temperature group; an output with a
`classifier` (`stress_category`, `HEAT_INDEX_STRESS_CATEGORY_BINS`) so the compliance column and the band palette run on bins; no
standard, so it appears only in Explore; a `min`-only applicability on `tdb` and none at all on `rh`, so the axis-range fallback
(declared, else applicability, else error) can answer for neither — both quantities must be declared. The dynamic chart is its only chart.

Only two files may be touched: create `src/models/heatIndexRothfusz.ts` (named after the library's `heat_index_rothfusz`, ADR-0002 decision 30; `heatIndex.ts` in the dry runs above), and add one line to `src/models/index.ts`.

**Done criteria (the hardest one in the whole plan)**
`git diff --stat` shows only `src/models/heatIndexRothfusz.ts` and `src/models/index.ts`.
**The moment a third file is touched, stop and fix the architecture** — fixing it in week four is an order of magnitude cheaper than in week ten.

Then a narrow pass over [code-quality-checklist.md](code-quality-checklist.md) covering **only those two files**: names,
declaration shape, no new mirrored value. Nothing in `core/` changes at this point — needing to change it means the
acceptance did not really pass.

## Phase 4b · PMV (ASHRAE 55) and Adaptive (ASHRAE 55) — when their `_INFO` lands upstream

**Prerequisites**: `PMV_PPD_ASHRAE_INFO` (with the compliance interval) and `ADAPTIVE_ASHRAE_INFO` (with the `offsets` field of #184 §6)
in the main repository. #203 item 3 schedules all-model metadata after #182; the app does not push on that (ADR-0002 decision 13).
Two app-side prerequisites, added 2026-09-22, because this is the phase where two models first share the Standard page:
**the model-switch dialog** (ADR-0002 decision 32, moved here from Phase 5 item 2; `.scratch/model-switch/`), including
the seeding of quantities the bag lacks — Adaptive's `t_running_mean` throws without it — and **the gate keeping the last
valid inputs of the current model** (decision 33; ticket 08 in `.scratch/numeric-scan-and-model-name/`), without which a
switch that breaks a bound shows one model's numbers under the other's name.
**Both are done, 2026-09-22**: the dialog as `9c67d63`, `0a35e39`, `6e6c36d` and `2ffddfe`, walked end to end in the
running app against a temporary second registered model (ticket 05, which also revises decision 32: every in-app way of
switching asks, the navigation links included); the gate as `6ad4caa`. This phase now waits on the two `_INFO`s alone.

1. PMV (ASHRAE 55): the former Phase 3.7 — `src/models/pmvPpdAshrae.ts` + one registry line, `options` (`airspeed_control`),
   and the ASHRAE cross-field air-speed rule's display. **Not the Worker, and not the `compute.svelte.ts` rewrite**
   (2026-09-21, ADR-0002 decision 29): the first is withdrawn, the second is Phase 4 prerequisite 4. What this model adds
   instead is a measurement: its 51×51 scan is timed in the browser, and decision 29 is reopened only past 300 ms. The rule arrives as `vr`
   rows on the result's `warnings` (ADR-0002 decision 23), up to three besides the 0–2 m/s one, all shown on the entered `v`;
   rows sharing a quantity read as one sentence over their `intersect`ed bound, a change in `core/applicability.ts` or
   `InputPanel.svelte`. The rule itself follows the library, not the deployed CBE (entered `v`, at `(tdb + tr) / 2`, against
   one limit clamped to 0.2–0.8 m/s); the difference is recorded, not ported.
   **Console logging (recorded 2026-09-15):** the migration dropped the fork's "writes nothing to the console" test, because the
   main repository's `cooling_effect` still logs "Assuming cooling effect = 0" per point and v1 calls no ASHRAE model. So
   `suppressWarnings` (Phase 3.7 item 4) must land upstream before the ASHRAE grid scan, and the silence test returns with it.
2. Adaptive (ASHRAE 55): `src/models/adaptiveAshrae.ts` + one registry line; locked axes `t_running_mean × operative_tmp`, exact
   band polygons from the adaptive bands in `src/temporary-library/`, `hasHumidityGroup` false because `rh` is not
   among its inputs. Same two-file rule as Phase 4. **The adaptive bands are ported here, not earlier** (ADR-0002 decision 9 as
   revised 2026-09-15): the migration ported only `psychrometricZone` and the root finders; the band geometry and the fork's
   adaptive `describe` blocks come with this model, reading labels and offsets from `ADAPTIVE_ASHRAE_INFO` rather than
   transcribing the fork's.

## Between Phase 4b and Phase 5 · Review the whole codebase and its architecture (added 2026-09-22)

**Why here and not on a calendar.** After Phase 4b three differently shaped declarations exist for the first time — ISO with no
options, ASHRAE with `options`, Adaptive with locked axes — so the shape of `RegisteredModel` can be judged on three points
instead of two. Compare then multiplies the slot state by three, after which `Session` and `InputSlot` are as good as
frozen. And it is the last time `git diff main...HEAD` equals the whole rewrite: once `rewrite/v1` merges, a change-based
review can no longer cover everything. **Not before Phase 4b's own close-out ticket has read the human half of the
checklist against the phase's diff**; that ticket's structure findings are this review's input. Nothing here runs mid-phase.

Four sessions, in this order, `/clear` between each:

1. **Code — `/code-review main`.** The spec is ADR-0001 + ADR-0002 + this plan; the standards are `docs/code-quality-checklist.md`
   + AGENTS.md. This is the first time the checklist is read across features rather than per feature diff, which is where
   duplicated definitions, two names for one thing, and a rule kept in one feature and not another show up. Findings go to
   `.scratch/review-after-4b/issues/`, one verifiable change per ticket, `/implement` each. A docs-versus-code disagreement is
   not fixed in code: it becomes an ADR-0002 decision plus an ADR-0001 marker, as the model-switch close-out did.
2. **Architecture — `/improve-codebase-architecture`**, only after item 1's tickets are done, so that smells are not reported
   as structure. Scope given up front: the three declarations, `RegisteredModel`, Compare about to triple the slots. Pick
   zero to two; more than two means a rule was worked around during 4b, which is a 4b question, not a refactor. Each pick is
   an idea that enters the main flow at `/grill-with-docs`.
3. **Vocabulary — `/domain-modeling` on `CONTEXT.md`, optional.** 4b brings `airspeed_control`, `t_running_mean`, the 80 % / 90 %
   acceptability limits, and a second model called PMV with different bands; the question is whether any term is now doing
   two jobs. Item 2's grilling usually pulls this in on its own; run it alone only for a term already felt to be fuzzy.
4. **Compare's `/grill-with-docs`** takes items 1–3's output as known input.

---

## Phase 5 · Compare / Explore / share and export

**Goal**: close out the ADR §7 first-stage feature set.
**Prerequisites**: Phase 4 passed, and the review between Phase 4b and Phase 5 above done.

1. Compare with three slots + baseline: `ResultTable` has one row per slot, and the baseline determines what the difference highlighting is relative to;
   slot colours run through the input panel, the table and the marker points on the chart.
2. Cross-model switch dialog (ADR §4.5): parameters for the same quantity are kept, and the
   "Boundary Range Warning" only pops up when a value exceeds the new model's hard range (table Input / Current / Allowed range,
   buttons "Yes, switch and adjust" / "No, stay here"); no out-of-range, no dialog.
   **Moved 2026-09-22 to a Phase 4b prerequisite** (ADR-0002 decision 32, which also settles what "hard range" is and the
   order of the switch). What stays here is its extension to all three slots, with item 1's Compare. Its look is Phase 5c item 5.
3. Explore threshold editor (rewritten 2026-09-21, ADR-0002 decision 31): a Band list is the library's `ClassifierBins`
   plus a colour per band — contiguous edges, the classifier's own `right` inclusivity, the library's edges kept exactly.
   The editor moves, adds and removes Edges (removing one merges two bands; a band with no colour leaves a range
   uncoloured), Reset returns to the classifier, and the list is saved per (model, chart) and included in the link;
   colours are assigned from the fixed palette by band position, and are editable. Edited bands colour the chart and
   the hover readout only; the result table always shows the kernel's category.
   **The Standard / Explore split lands here**: Explore draws the bands, and Standard's dynamic chart switches to the
   comfort zone only, filled as the psychrometric chart fills it and blank outside, reading the one comfort-limit
   constant exported from `src/temporary-library/` beside the zone solver. **There is no "show zones" toggle.**
4. `src/core/shareLink.ts`: `?share=v1.<Base64URL(JSON)>`, schema in ADR §4.8.
   **This is the only file in the whole project that reads and writes string ids** (`Quantity.key`, each closed set's `.id` / `xxxFromId()`).
   On a parse failure, fall back to defaults and notify; no blank screen.
   Skipped: `migrate()` (v1 has no source to migrate from; write it in v2) and `v1z.` deflate + `fflate`
   (together with Time-series, see below).
5. Export Link + image export: editable title + input summary + tool name/version/date footer, PNG + SVG. The same
   `ChartSpec.legend` generates Plotly's horizontal bottom legend in the export layout, so screen and file agree — the
   modebar's own PNG button was removed in Phase 3 precisely because it could not do this.
6. `RegisteredModel.timeSeries` lands with `workspace.ts`, which is its first consumer.
7. The `Proxy`-less fallback is a static notice in `index.html` naming the required browser versions (ADR §2 / §7.5,
   decided 2026-09-04). No second ES5 code path, no share decoding.

**Done criteria**
- From any state, Export Link → open in a new tab → the state is identical (three slots, units, chart type, thresholds, numbers)
- Opening a share link in an environment with `Proxy` disabled does not crash

---

## Phase 5b · Input calculators

**Goal**: the calculator buttons of the old tool's input panel, with the semantics ADR §4.1.5 already fixed — a one-shot
Apply that writes into a target input, never entering the session or the share link.
**Prerequisites**: Phase 5 (they write into slots, and Compare decides which slot).

Scope was narrowed on 2026-09-04 to exactly three; `Globe temp` is explicitly out:

1. **Custom clothing ensemble** — build a garment list from the library's `clo_individual_garments`, Apply writes `clo`.
2. **Dynamic predictive clothing** — `clo_dynamic_ashrae` / `clo_dynamic_iso` (split 2026-09-05; the ISO one also takes `v` and `i_a`), Apply writes `clo`.
3. **Solar gain on occupants** — confirm first whether the fork already ports it; if not, that is a library task, since
   the formula is general (ADR §3).

The declaration field that says which model offers which calculator is added here, not earlier: Phase 4's acceptance is
already past, and an optional field with no consumer would be exactly the speculative abstraction the ADR forbids.

---

## Phase 5c · The interface, designed

**Goal**: stop looking like a wireframe. Everything before this phase was correctness; this one is the product.
**Prerequisites**: Phase 5. That is the point — Compare's three slots, the Explore workspace and the threshold editor
all change the layout, so a design drawn before them would be redrawn after them.

1. The three columns as designed rather than as stacked: real proportions, real density, a considered
   information hierarchy. The architecture is fixed (ADR §1), the execution is not.
2. Header and footer — title, unit switch, Documentation link, version / date / licence, Reset. **Moved here from
   Phase 6** on 2026-09-04: they are design work, not wrap-up chores.
3. One palette across UI and charts. `core/bandPalette.ts`'s `chartInk` is currently hand-picked hex against the CBE
   fills; it becomes part of the design system rather than a chart-local constant.
4. Responsive behaviour, and the result table's horizontal overflow — legible since Phase 2, never designed.
5. The model-switch dialog mock-up ADR §7.4 refers to. It is produced here; until then that criterion is judged on
   content, not appearance.

**Why not earlier**: the lint rule that bans Tailwind utilities outside `ui/primitives/` and `ui/layout/` (ADR §2) is
what makes deferring safe. Visual change reaches the app through tokens, primitives and the three layout components —
business components never encode appearance, so redesigning them is not a rewrite of them.

**Done criteria**
- No hand-written CSS left in business components that a token or a primitive should be carrying.
- The four scripts still pass, and no business component's logic changed to accommodate the design.

---

## Phase 6 · UTCI acceptance + v1 wrap-up

**Goal**: ADR §7 acceptance #1, then close out.
**Prerequisites**: Phase 5.

1. Library side: port `utci` from the JS on the `main` branch into the TS on `typescript`
   (a polynomial, stateless, the cheapest one outside the 8 already-ported models), add `io.utci`, attach
   `label` / `description` / `limits` / classification scale, and add the missing quantities to `quantities`.
2. App side: **add only `src/models/utci.ts` + one registry line**, zero other files change, and it appears only in the
   Explore navigation (no `standard` attached in the library). `table` is required, so UTCI declares it too.
3. Run all nine ADR §7 acceptance items (item 3 compares vertex geometry).
4. One line of gtag; send `page_view` manually on route change, with the query string stripped from `page_location`
   (do not send the share payload to Google).
5. Merge back into `main`, remove the `git worktree`.

The site shell (header, footer, Reset) was briefly assigned here on 2026-09-04 and moved to Phase 5c the same day:
it is design work, and doing it apart from the design would mean doing it twice. `Save` / `Reload` are not built at
all — Export Link covers them.

**After v1**: local discomfort (ankle draft, vertical air temperature difference) as standalone models under the ASHRAE tab; the remaining 5 models (heat_index / humidex / wind_chill / PHS / adaptive_en,
each = library port + one declaration file + one registry line) → Time-series + PHS + `v1z.` compression
→ ES5 summary page (depends on the share schema being frozen, hence last) → UI/e2e/visual tests.

---

## Key constraints (bring these into every new chat)

**Import direction (made into ESLint rules, configured in Phase 0)**
- `src/core/**` must not import `svelte` / `src/state` / `src/ui` — pure TS, runnable under node
- `src/ui/charts/PlotlyChart.svelte` must not import any model; it consumes only a `ChartSpec`
- Tailwind utility classes are **allowed only** in `src/ui/primitives/` (generated by the shadcn CLI, not edited)
  and `src/ui/layout/` (`Stack`/`Grid`/`Inline`, gap via props); their appearance in any other directory is an error

**Single entry points** (rewritten 2026-09-13, ADR-0002 decisions 2, 3, 12)
- Everything comes from the `jsthermalcomfort` package root; there are no subpaths. The library's **model functions** are
  imported only in `src/models/` (the declaration's `run`) and `src/workers/` (the actual call), enforced by
  `no-restricted-imports` `importNames`; `_INFO`, `Standard`, `classifyFromBins` and the psychrometrics can be imported anywhere
- `src/core/quantities.ts` is the single definition of quantities (`{ key, kind, label }`); `key` is the `_INFO` key
- String ids appear in only two places: `Quantity.key` at the library boundary (a declaration's `run` naming each params
  key, which the compiler checks; `core/applicability.ts` indexing `_INFO`, `core/standard.ts` reading `Standard`'s keys), and `src/core/shareLink.ts`
- Unit conversion only in `src/core/units.ts`, with the formulas written in the app (the ADR §3 exception); the canonical stored state is always SI
- Number formatting only in `src/core/numberFormat.ts`

**Syntax**
- Runes only; ESLint forbids `export let` / `$:` / `on:` / `<slot>` / `<svelte:component>`
- No `enum` / `namespace` / constructor parameter properties (`erasableSyntaxOnly`)
- Closed sets are `as const` object collections + derived union types; behaviour is written as plain functions, not `switch`ed on everywhere, and no enum classes
- Quantity names come only from `Quantity.label`; hard-coded names such as "Air temperature" do not appear in the app
- Run generated `.svelte` files through `svelte-autofixer` (the Svelte MCP is installed)

**Things not to write** (rewritten 2026-09-13, ADR-0002)
Any transcribed applicability or classification number (they are read from `_INFO`), a root finder or zone solver written
from scratch (`src/temporary-library/` is **ported from the fork**, tests included), a `Measure` / `Outcome` / `io` layer over the
model's own result object, a hand-written name or route segment per standard (generated from `Standard`'s key), `defineModel`,
`InputCalculator`, `sequentialSimulation`, `evaluateMany`, `migrate()`, `fflate`; on the library side, `Unit` / `InputSpec` /
`OptionSpec` / `ModelDefinition` / the `models` registry / a quantities table with labels (they belong to the app); on the app
side, enum classes.

## Verification

Run at the end of every Phase:

```bash
npm run check && npm run lint && npm run build && npm test
```

Behaviour comparison (from Phase 3 on):

```bash
cd ../comfort-tool-old && npm i && npm run dev   # the old tool runs on another port
```

Compare item by item under the same inputs: result-table values, psychrometric chart comfort-zone vertices (≤ 0.01 °C),
Adaptive band boundaries, SI/IP round trip.

Phase 4's architecture acceptance is judged by `git diff --stat`, and so is Phase 6's UTCI acceptance.
If either fails, stop and fix the architecture; do not work around it.
