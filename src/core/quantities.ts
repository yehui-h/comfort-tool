 * Every physical quantity the app shows, in one table (ADR-0002 decision 2).

 * names it. Outside tests, this table is the one place a quantity's key is
 * written as a string, besides the share link that carries it; every other
 * module holds the row itself, compared by identity, never the key.
 *
 * `kindBounds`, beside the kinds, holds the range a kind is defined over,
 * whatever the model; the pre-call gate reads it (ADR-0002 decision 46).
 * `DEFAULT_ATMOSPHERIC_PRESSURE` is `p_atm`'s value until the user enters
 * another, written once here (ADR-0002 decision 49).
 *
 * Node strips this file's types natively (`erasableSyntaxOnly`), so
 * `eslint.config.js` imports it directly, without a build step, for the key
 * list of the lint rule that bans a quantity's key as a string literal.
